# EcoDynamics.jl

**EcoDynamics.jl** is a package for simulation of ecosystem processes,
specifically population and community dynamics on spatial graphs, written in the
_Julia_ language.

This documentation is structured loosely using the
[Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) format, which separates documentation into four
forms:

1. Tutorials (a _learning-oriented_ guided exploration of the software)
2. How-to-Guides (a _goal-oriented_ set of directions to accomplish something specific)
3. Reference (_information-oriented_ "techinical descriptions of the machinery")
4. Explanation (_understanding-oriented_ discussions on the software design)
