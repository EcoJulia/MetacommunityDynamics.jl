# EcoDynamics.jl

**EcoDynamics.jl** is a package for simulation of ecosystem processes,
specifically population and community dynamics on spatial graphs, written in the
_Julia_ language. 

!!! info
    Note that EcoDynamics.jl is still under development, and although the API is
    not expected to change a ton, we still do not yet guarantee it will remain
    constant until the first `v1.0` productoin release. 


This documentation is structured loosely using the
[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) format, which separates documentation into four
forms:

1. Tutorials (a _learning-oriented_ guided exploration of the software)
2. How-to Guides (a _goal-oriented_ set of directions to accomplish something specific)
3. Reference (_information-oriented_ "techinical descriptions of the machinery")
4. Explanation (_understanding-oriented_ discussions on the software design)
