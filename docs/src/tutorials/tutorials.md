# Tutorials

1. Running Dynamics
- The logistic map. 
- The `model`, `Problem`, `simulate` API
- Customization

Meant to be a guide to up to the spatialize API, but only consider results up to
aggregated across all sites. For differences in sites, see tutorial tbd.  

2. Consumer-Resource Models

- Basic LV
- Custom functional response
- YodzisInnes and trait models
- Many species models
- Putting it all together

3. Dispersal 

- Spatial Graphs
- Environmental Covariates
- Dispersal Kernels and Potentials
- Diffusion

4. Adding Stochaticity

- note refering to reference section on how EcoDynamics treats discrete-time
  determ/stoch models the same 

Build up to Gaussian drift to LV many species system on a SG

5. Letting the environment influence species interactions 
- Assumes previous tutorials
- strong env gradient from NL.jl


5. Inference
- Bayes integration tutorial
