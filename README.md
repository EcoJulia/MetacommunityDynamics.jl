EcoDynamics.jl is a package for generalizable simulation of
population and community dynamics, both local and on spatial graphs.
The package includes many 'classic' models from population, community, metapopulation, and metacommunity ecology, but enables extension by allowing users to define custom models.

[Here's the link to the documentation](https://gottacatchenall.github.io/EcoDynamics.jl/dev).


> **Warning**
> The EcoDynamics.jl package is currently under development. The API is not expected to change a lot, but it may change in order to facilitate the integration of new features. Not all functionality is guaranteed to function until the first production release.
